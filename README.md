Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist medications are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity through insulin secretion, glucagon inhibition, appetite suppression, and delay of gastric emptying. Liraglutide is one of the agonists that are marketed globally. In the U.S. and Canada, liraglutide-containing products list "elevation of liver enzymes" as an adverse reaction; this is not reflected in the product inserts of other countries. Similarly, not all GLP-1 agonist labels include liver enzyme elevation as an adverse reaction despite case reports of liraglutide-related acute liver injury. 

In light of increased GLP-1 usage globally, this study aims to evaluate the risk of acute liver injury in T2DM users of GLP-1 agonists.
